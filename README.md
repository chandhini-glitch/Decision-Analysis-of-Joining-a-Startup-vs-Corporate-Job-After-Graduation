# Decision & Risk Analytics: Startup vs Corporate Career Choice

## Project Overview
This project applies **Decision and Risk Analytics** to analyze a real-life career dilemma faced by many graduates:  
**Should one join a high-risk startup or choose a stable corporate job after graduation?**

Instead of relying on intuition, this project uses a **structured, quantitative decision-making framework** to evaluate each option under uncertainty and identify the alternative that maximizes long-term value.

The analysis is especially relevant for **international students**, where factors such as job stability, career growth, and visa sponsorship play a critical role in decision-making.

---

## Problem Statement
Graduates often face uncertainty when choosing between:
- A **startup role** offering high growth but high risk
- A **corporate role** offering stability and predictable career progression

This project models these uncertainties explicitly and compares outcomes using **decision science techniques**.

---

## Methodology
The project follows a systematic decision-analytics approach:

- Defined decision alternatives: **Startup vs Corporate**
- Identified key objectives:
  - Career Growth
  - Salary / Financial Rewards
  - Job Satisfaction
- Modeled uncertainties such as:
  - Startup success/failure
  - Career progression outcomes
- Built a **Decision Tree** to represent possible scenarios
- Used **Influence Diagrams** to visualize dependencies
- Assigned probabilities and utility values to outcomes
- Calculated **Expected Utility** for each decision path

---

## Tools & Techniques
- Decision Trees
- Influence Diagrams
- Utility Theory
- Scenario Analysis
- Expected Value & Utility Calculations
- Excel-based Decision Modeling
- PrecisionTree (conceptual application)

---

## Key Findings
- Even under optimistic assumptions for the startup path, the **corporate job produced a higher expected utility**
- Corporate roles offered:
  - Greater long-term stability
  - More predictable career growth
  - Lower risk exposure
- The startup option showed high variance with significant downside risk

---

## Conclusion
The analysis demonstrates how **structured decision analytics** can transform complex, emotional life decisions into **clear, data-driven conclusions**.

Rather than asking *“What feels right?”*, this project answers:
> *“Which option provides the highest long-term value under uncertainty?”*
