# Decision-Analysis-of-Joining-a-Startup-vs-Corporate-Job-After-Graduation
This project applies Decision and Risk Analytics techniques to evaluate a critical post-graduation career choice: joining a high-risk startup or accepting a stable corporate role. The analysis focuses on structured decision-making under uncertainty rather than intuition.
